function varargout = gs2015(varargin)
% GS2015 MATLAB code for gs2015.fig
%      GS2015, by itself, creates a new GS2015 or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = GS2015 returns the handle to a new GS2015 or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      GS2015('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in GS2015.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      GS2015('Property','Value',...) creates a new GS2015 or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before gs2015_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to gs2015_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
